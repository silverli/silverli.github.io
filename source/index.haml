  %p{:id => 'about'} Hi, I'm Lindsay :)
  %p After graduating from Haverford College in May, I've immersed myself in all aspects of web development and design. At my current job in the Haverford College Digital Scholarship Department, I've been helping the Digital Scholarship staff to make websites that are both informational and scholarly, but are also well organized, and have interesting features and manipulations of data. In particular, I spent a lot of the summer of 2015 working on the Quakers & Mental Health Project and alone, have created its digital platform from the ground up. Learn more about the QMH project here .

  %p In addition to being fascinated by the visualizations you can make with data, I also love the creative side of web development--the feeling that I'm painting some sort of strange HTML/CSS canvas that I refresh over and over, and eventually end up obtaining something beautiful, and furthermore, something useful and thought-provoking.
