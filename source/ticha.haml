    %h3 About the  Project
    %p I helped to not only make the entire site more responsive, but also did extensive work with JavaScript and the Omeka API in order to create a new way for users to interact with the available Zapotec manuscripts. I used DataTables, a jQuery plugin, to display the available metadata, and also allow for easy searching and re-orderering of the information. The diagram belows gives a bit more detail about what exactly went into Ticha to make the site, and digital exploration of the manuscripts possible. Also, in the video below, you can view the changes I made to Ticha--the website on the left is the one with my changes, and the one of the right is the original.
    %p This website was also the subject of a recent presentation by the Ticha team in Madrid at the Hispanic Digital Humanities Association International Conference (Oct 5-7). The title of the presentation was: "Archives, morphological analysis, & XML encoding: interdisciplinary methods in the creation of a digital text explorer for Colonial Zapotec manuscripts."
